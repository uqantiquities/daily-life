## Introduction

Written sources can tell us a lot about the major events and the political and military figures of Greece and Rome, but they pay less attention to the lives of regular Greeks and Romans living in ancient towns and cities. In particular, there isnâ€™t much written about people of the lower classes, about women and children, or about slaves and other marginalised groups. Archaeological evidence and ancient artefacts help us to tell these stories and provide evidence for the lives of groups not well represented in the literature.  
This audio guide will provide an introduction to some aspects of everyday life in the ancient world: what people ate and drank, what they did for fun, and the kinds of clothes and ornaments they might have worn.
