## Χαιρε! Welcome! 

In this audio tour, we will explore the world of the Greeks and Romans in their towns and cities, focusing on what people ate and drank, what they did for fun, and the kinds of clothes and ornaments they might wear. We will also consider evidence for marginalised groups in ancient society, such as women, and slaves.
