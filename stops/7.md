## Greek Theatre
A favourite form of entertainment for the Greeks and Romans was the theatre. 

Greek theatre as we know it appeared around the 6th and 5th centuries BC and is associated with festivals of the god Dionysos. It played a very important role in the development of a Panhellenic or ‘Greek’ identity, by bringing together people to share dramatic productions of common myths, stories, songs and poems. 

The Greeks drew a formal distinction between different kinds of theatre. The two main types were tragedy and comedy, and we have many surviving examples of both types. With the spread of Greek culture into Rome, theatre increased in popularity and diversified, with new types of performance developing, such as pantomime. 

This terracotta figurine, probably a souvenir, depicts an actor sitting cross-legged on a bench with his chin resting on his right hand. He wears a comic mask, representing the Leading Slave of New Comedy. The second smaller mask resting on the bench beside him is also of the comic slave variety. 

## Being an Actor
Actors in Greece were always men, and always wore masks to show who their character was meant to be. Tragedies and Comedies were often a form of social commentary – nothing was off limits – topics such as class and gender conflict, violence, sex, politics, greed, treachery and betrayal, loyalty, heroism, and self-sacrifice were all explored in the realm of theatre.

When theatre spread to Rome, plays were first performed in Greek, and later the old Greek plays were translated into Latin. These ‘translations’ were more accurately ‘remakes’, with Latin authors freely adapting Greek originals to better suit Roman audiences. Theatre was an incredibly popular past time in ancient Greece and Rome. People of all backgrounds would come together in the theatre to watch stories being performed.
