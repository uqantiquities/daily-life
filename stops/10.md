This stop concludes your tour. 

In this audio tour, we have explored the world of the Greeks and Romans and discovered what daily life was like in the ancient world. Ancient artefacts allow us to reach beyond the political and military histories we usually find in written texts and gain some understanding of the perspectives and experiences different groups such as women and slaves. They also help us to think about other parts of everyday life in the ancient world: what people ate and drank, what they did for fun, and the kinds of clothes and ornaments they might wear. 

Thank you for joining us at the R.D. Milns Antiquities Museum.

Please wait at this final stop for further instructions from your tour guide about how to return your iPads and headphones.
